# Genetic analysis of region-wise brain-age gaps

Everything downstream of the brain-age model: the GWAS of each regional
brain-age gap (BAG) in UK Biobank, its replication in ADNI, LD score regression
(SNP heritability and genetic correlation), and MAGMA cell-type enrichment.

The model that produces the phenotype lives in the repository root; this
directory starts from the per-region BAG table it writes.

Paths, host names and container references were lifted out into
`config/paths.env`. Analysis settings were not touched: every SAIGE, PLINK,
LDSC and MAGMA flag, the bias-correction formula, the point at which the
inverse-normal transform is applied, the covariate lists, and the cell-type
retention rule are byte-for-byte what produced the published numbers.
`validation/verify_release.py` re-runs the released scripts against the original
inputs and diffs the result against the published tables — see
[Verification](#verification).

## Setup

```bash
cp gwas/config/paths.env.example gwas/config/paths.env
$EDITOR gwas/config/paths.env          # every site-specific path lives here
```

Shell scripts read it through `config/common.sh`. Python scripts read the same
variables from the environment:

```bash
set -a; . gwas/config/paths.env; set +a
```

`config/regions.tsv` maps region codes to display names and records which cohort
each region was run in.

                       03_merge_munged.py, then the same h² and rg steps

  06_prs               SBayesRC weights → scoring → ST17 / ST18 / ST21-23
                       (runs off 01's TRAINING-split sumstats)
```

`05_magma_celltype` cannot start until the FUMA SNP2GENE job has finished, and
`03_postgwas`'s concordance step needs both cohorts' summary statistics.

`06_prs` is the one branch that must not see the full sample: its weights are
fitted on the training split only, so the held-out validation in ST17 stays held
out. It is also the one branch that needs `--thread 1` to be reproducible:
SBayesRC is an MCMC sampler and lands on different weights from run to run when
it is threaded. The weights are deposited for this reason.
`06_prs/README.md` has the measurements.

## What each stage needs

| stage | needs |
|---|---|
| `01_ukb_gwas` | UK Biobank imputed BGEN + `.bgi` + sample file, an LD-pruned PLINK1 set for the GRM, and the per-region BAG phenotype table. Approved UK Biobank application. |
| `02_adni_replication` | ADNI imputed dosage pgen, the QC sample list, in-sample PCA eigenvectors, genotyping-batch indicators, and the model's ADNI predictions. Approved ADNI data access. |
| `03_postgwas` | merged summary statistics from both cohorts. |
| `04_ldsc` | a clone of [bulik/ldsc](https://github.com/bulik/ldsc) and its EUR LD-score panels (`eur_ref_ld_chr`, `eur_w_ld_chr`). The two external ageing traits are built here as well, from `LDSC_TELOMERE_RAW_SUMSTATS` (GWAS Catalog accession GCST90435144) and `LDSC_PROTEIN_AGE_RAW_SUMSTATS` (the merged SAIGE output for the proteomic-age gap); neither file is redistributed here. The phenotypic-correlation columns additionally need individual-level BAG tables. |
| `05_magma_celltype` | MAGMA v1.10, the 1000 Genomes phase 3 EUR reference (GRCh37) with an ENSG gene annotation, FUMA's pre-processed single-cell expression matrices, FUMA's `magma_celltype.R`, and one `magma.genes.raw` per region from a FUMA SNP2GENE job. |

### Phenotype table

One row per participant, `IID` plus the covariates, plus one column per region
named `{region}_corrected_delta_age_int` — the bias-corrected brain-age gap
after a rank-based inverse-normal transform. UK Biobank covariates are
`Sex, Age, PC1..PC10`; ADNI adds genotyping-batch dummies, because ADNI was
genotyped in several waves.

`02_adni_replication/build_pheno.py` builds the ADNI table from the model's
predictions. The order is fixed and matters: fit the age-bias regression on
cognitively normal baseline scans, apply it to all baseline scans, restrict to
the final genotyped sample, and only then inverse-normal transform, per region.
Fitting the correction on the analysis sample, or transforming before
restricting, changes the phenotype.

### FUMA dependency

Two distinct things come from FUMA and neither is redistributed here.

1. **Gene analysis.** `magma.genes.raw` per region comes from a FUMA SNP2GENE
   job (FUMA v1.8.2; the job's own MAGMA is v1.10). Upload the files written by
   `01_ukb_gwas/make_fuma_input.sh`, then download the MAGMA results and point
   `FUMA_GENES_RAW_TMPL` at them. Running MAGMA's gene analysis locally is *not*
   equivalent — see [Local vs FUMA gene analysis](#local-vs-fuma-gene-analysis).
2. **Cell-type expression matrices and the cell-type script.** The
   pre-processed single-cell resource (`celltype/*.txt`, downloaded 2026-07-12;
   876 files, of which 679 are the human-brain datasets FUMA itself uses) and
   `storage/scripts/magma_celltype.R` from the
   [FUMA-webapp](https://github.com/Kyoko-wtnb/FUMA-webapp) repository. Steps 1,
   2 and 3 of the cell-type analysis are that script, run unmodified; the only
   part re-implemented here is step 3's pairwise loop, described under
   [The step-3 parallel driver](#the-step-3-parallel-driver).
   `05_magma_celltype/checks/` contains the comparisons that established our runs
   reproduce FUMA's own output exactly.

Record the FUMA version and access date for anything you re-run; FUMA's
pre-processed resource is updated over time and the dataset list is not stable
across versions.

## One release throughout

Every branch of this pipeline — LD score regression, the MAGMA cell-type
analysis and the ADNI replication — runs on the same UK Biobank release,
N = 41,067. `04_ldsc/02_munge.sh` still takes N as an explicit argument; pass
the N of whatever release you feed it.

## Local vs FUMA gene analysis

An early pass ran MAGMA's gene analysis locally against a full-Ensembl
annotation (49,329 genes) and the results were discarded: FUMA's annotation is
protein-coding only (19,011 genes), which changes `NGENES` (22,933 vs 16,777)
and flips significance for 21 cell types. The published
analysis uses FUMA's `magma.genes.raw`. `05_magma_celltype/01_gene_analysis_local.sh`
and `deprecated_pass1_gene_property.sh` are kept for the record and are not part
of the published pipeline; their headers say so.

## Effect-allele orientation in the LDSC branch

Worth understanding before adding a trait, because it is invisible in the output
and only shows up as a sign.

LDSC reads `A1` as the effect allele. SAIGE reports `BETA` and `AF_Allele2` for
`Allele2`, so `01_preprocess.py` writes `A1 = Allele2` into the merge-alleles
list and `02_munge.sh` passes `--a1 Allele2 --a2 Allele1`. The munged `Z`
therefore refers to the allele named in `A1`, which is what a downstream reader
assumes. `munge_sumstats.py` never re-signs `Z` — its `allele_merge` only drops
SNPs that fail to match the merge-alleles list — so this setting controls the
`A1` label and nothing else.

Earlier runs passed `--a1 Allele1`, which put the *other* allele in `A1` and
inverted every sign relative to the label. That did not corrupt any published
number. `validation/allele_convention_check.txt` is the measurement behind that
sentence: on chromosome 22 of the whole-brain GWAS the correction puts `A1` on
the effect allele for 105,260 of 105,260 SNPs (0 of 105,260 before) while
leaving the `Z` column byte-identical and heritability at 0.3566 (0.126) either
way. The same inversion was carried by every file this pipeline correlates —
`pad_<region>`, the proteomic-age munge, and the telomere munge (its `A1` came
from `other_allele`) — and rg depends only on the product `Z1*Z2`, so two files
sharing the inversion give an unchanged result; heritability is built from
chi-square and involves no sign at all. The summary statistics released with the
paper were produced under the old convention and are left as they are; the
change above applies to any future run.

A separate matter, which does bite, is **allele order**. Whether a GWAS reports a
variant as `Allele1=C, Allele2=T` or the reverse is a property of the genotype
source, not of the phenotype, and it differs between runs:

| pair | allele order |
|---|---|
| `pad_<region>` (N=41,067) vs proteomic age | same for 7,268,105 of 7,268,132 shared SNPs |
| `pad_<region>` (N=41,067) vs telomere | **opposite** for essentially every shared SNP |
| `pad_<region>` (N=45,076) vs telomere | same — this is why the original strict align worked |

The first aligner written for this step was a strict-match one: it kept only SNPs
whose `A1`/`A2` matched the reference exactly. On the released N=41,067 sumstats
that returns an empty telomere file rather than an error, because the allele order
is opposite for essentially every shared SNP. `align_flip.py` applies the same
restriction but flips `Z` on the order-swapped SNPs, which is the correct
alignment in both cases: run against the N=45,076 inputs it reproduces the
published `telomere_<region>_aligned.sumstats.gz` row for row with `max|dZ| = 0`,
and against the released inputs it produces a file with the same meaning. It is
the only aligner shipped here, and every external correlation in the correlation
table uses it.

The ProtAge-204 x telomere row of that table uses the same two steps as the ten
ProtAge-204 x BAG rows, with telomere length in place of a BAG phenotype:
`align_flip.py --source_file <telomere munged> --reference_file <ProtAge-204 munged>`,
then `06_genetic_correlation.sh <ProtAge-204 munged> <aligned telomere> <out prefix>`.
The released row (rg = -0.1787, Z = -3.9597, P = 7.5033e-05) came from an alignment
reporting `shared=6812697 exact=0 swapped=6812691 other_dropped=6`.

Add a trait and the thing to check is its allele order against `pad_<region>`;
`align_flip.py` prints `exact=` and `swapped=` counts so the answer is in the log.

### The step-3 parallel driver

For most regions FUMA's R script runs step 3 serially without trouble. Cerebellum
had 158 retained cell types spread over 158 datasets, i.e. C(158,2) = 12,403
cross-dataset pairs and roughly 83 hours of serial MAGMA. `04_step3_parallel.py`
ports that pairwise loop only — the forward selection is untouched — and was
validated to zero difference against the R output on five regions.

One detail there is load-bearing: R's `write.table` re-formats the covariate
matrix at 15 significant digits, and MAGMA's p-value for a collinear-sensitive
pair depends on that. The driver writes `%.15g` to match, which makes its
intermediate files byte-identical to R's.

## Verification

```bash
set -a; . gwas/config/paths.env; set +a
python gwas/validation/verify_release.py \
    --h2-reference       published/Table_S14.tsv \
    --rg-reference       published/Table_S15.tsv \
    --celltype-reference published/Table_S16.tsv \
    --retained-signals   retained_signals.tsv \
    --significant-set    significant_set.tsv
```

Each reference is the published supplementary table exported as TSV. A check
whose reference is not given is skipped; the script exits non-zero if any check
that ran failed. Against the manuscript workbook all four pass, every cell:

| check | what it rebuilds | compared |
|---|---|---|
| `h2` | the heritability table, from the standalone LDSC `--h2` logs | 12 × 12 |
| `rg` | the correlation table, by running both correlation builders | 66 × 9 |
| `celltype / retention rule` | the retained set from the significant set | 209 of 264, per-region split |
| `celltype / table` | the published cell-type table from the retained signals | 209 × 20 |

Comparison is cell by cell but not character by character: the published tables
are a spreadsheet export, which stores numbers and renders them to a fixed
width, so `validation/compare_tables.py` treats a rebuilt value as equal when
rounding it to the digits the reference shows reproduces the reference. It also
understands `<1e-300`-style bounds. Anything else is a mismatch.

One check sits outside `verify_release.py`:
`validation/allele_convention_check.txt` records the chromosome-22 comparison
behind the allele-labelling note above, and the commands to re-run it.

Three details are worth knowing before reading a failure:

- The h² printed inside an `--rg` log is a *different* estimate — LDSC re-fits
  it on the two-trait SNP intersection — and is not what the heritability table
  reports. `build_h2_table.py` refuses a log that is not a standalone `--h2`
  run.
- The ten brain rows of the heritability table went through a builder that
  fixed the number of decimals; the two external-trait rows were transcribed
  from their logs and kept the log's own precision. `h2_table_traits.tsv` marks
  those rows `verbatim`.
- The correlation table's FDR families are the inter-regional 45 and the
  external-aging 21, computed separately. Where LDSC printed `P: 0.` the table
  shows `<2.2e-308` and the FDR used 5e-324, which preserves the ranking.

## What cannot be reproduced from this repository

No genotypes, imaging, phenotypes, participant identifiers, summary statistics or
model weights are included. UK Biobank and ADNI data are available to approved
researchers through their own access processes, and the analyses above cannot be
run without them.

Two further limits are worth stating plainly. The phenotypic-correlation columns
of the correlation table need individual-level brain-age gaps, so they cannot be
recomputed from summary statistics alone. And the broad cell class attached to
each significant cell type was assigned by hand rather than derived by rule,
which is why it ships as a lookup table (`cell_class_map.tsv`) instead of as
code.
