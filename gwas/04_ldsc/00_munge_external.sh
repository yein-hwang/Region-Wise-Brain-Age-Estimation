# Munge the two external ageing traits that ST15 correlates against the regional
# BAG GWAS: telomere length PC1 and the ProtAge-204 proteomic-age gap.
#
# The munge command is NOT repeated here. This script only resolves the
# trait-specific sample size and hands off to 02_munge.sh, which is the same
# invocation used for pad_<region>, so there is exactly one place in the release
# where munge_sumstats.py is called and one place where --a1/--a2 are set.
#
# What differs per trait is the input, the preprocess step that produced the
# per-chromosome files under $LDSC_WORK_DIR/files/<trait>, and --N:
#
#   telomere_pc1   N = 438351   00_preprocess_telomere.py
#                  Input: LDSC_TELOMERE_RAW_SUMSTATS (GWAS Catalog GCST90435144).
#                  N is the file's own `n` column. It is constant at 438351 over
#                  all 9,589,468 rows of the 22 per-chromosome preprocess outputs
#                  that were munged. The raw Catalog download carries a second
#                  value for a minority of variants (438351 for 14,587,804 rows;
#                  438170 for 434,898), all of which fall outside the munged set.
#                  The released sumstats were munged with --N 438351.0.
#
#   protage204     N = 43710    01_preprocess.py
#                  Input: LDSC_PROTEIN_AGE_RAW_SUMSTATS, the merged SAIGE step-2
#                  output for the ProtAge-204 proteomic-age gap. N is the SAIGE
#                  step-1 analysed sample size and equals the N column (field 14)
#                  of that file, which the original run verified to be constant
#                  before munging. The released sumstats were munged with
#                  --N 43710.0.
#
# ProtAge-204 needs no external-specific preprocess script. Its input is ordinary
# SAIGE output (CHR POS MarkerID Allele1 Allele2 AC_Allele2 AF_Allele2 ... BETA
# SE ... p.value N), so 01_preprocess.py applies to it unchanged.
#
# Usage: bash 00_munge_external.sh telomere_pc1
#        bash 00_munge_external.sh protage204
